## Conflicting definitions

| Team | Definition | Count |
|---|---|---:|
| Finance | Customer with recognized revenue during the trailing 90-day reporting window. | 1,600 |
| Sales | Customer with an open or won opportunity updated during the trailing 180 days. | 1,500 |
| Customer Success | Customer with an active contract and qualifying product usage in the trailing 30 days. | 1,334 |

## Proposed canonical definition

Active Customer means a customer with an active contract and qualifying usage in the trailing 30 days. Finance and Sales variants remain named domain views and must not publish under the unqualified canonical term.

- **Source definition:** `active_customer_customer_success`
- **Rationale:** The three executed definitions diverge by 266 customers and 33,198,000.00 ARR. The proposed canonical definition uses the contract and usage semantics from Customer Success Active Customer; Finance Active Customer remains a governed financial activity view.
- **Expected dashboard impact:** Up to 266 customers and 33,198,000.00 ARR differ across current views.
